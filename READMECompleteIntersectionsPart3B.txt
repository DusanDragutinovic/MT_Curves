In CompleteIntersectionsPart3B_prepare_data.py, all the important data is collected.

We changed the names of some lists, in order of the implementation to be more efficient. 

Orbits are now OP[1], OP[3], OP[4] and OP[6], and the lists of matrices mapping to the representative
of an orbit are called matricesP[1], matricesP[3], matricesP[4] and matricesP[6] (they were called list_of_matrices1, list_of_matrices3, list_of_matrices4 and list_of_matrices6).

Reduced lists list_i and three_in_P_i_list_j are now, P_list[i] and P_list[iii][j]. 

CompleteIntersectionsPart3B_main.py is the main program for the third part.
